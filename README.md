# Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm
This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, allowing an AI to learn to play the game autonomously. NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks to perform tasks, in this case, playing Flappy Bird.


# Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm.git


# Install the required Python modules using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


This command will install the necessary dependencies, including neat-python and pygame.


# Usage
Manual Gameplay (Base Model Flappy Bird)
To play Flappy Bird manually, follow these steps:

Open the Base Model Flappy Bird.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to play the game.

Follow the instructions within the notebook to control the bird and navigate through the pipes.


AI Gameplay (NEAT Algo Flappy Bird)
To watch an AI agent play Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm, follow these steps:

Open the NEAT Algo Flappy Bird.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to train the NEAT algorithm and observe the AI playing the game.

Follow the instructions within the notebook for further guidance on running and modifying the code.


# Notes
Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system before running the notebooks.


# Configuration
The feedforward.txt file contains the NEAT configuration parameters. You can adjust these parameters to change the behavior of the NEAT algorithm and experiment with different settings to improve the AI's performance.

 # Acknowledgments
This project is based on the implementation of Flappy Bird by sourabhv.
NEAT algorithm implementation is provided by NEAT-Python.
