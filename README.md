# Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm
Flappy Bird with NEAT Algorithm
This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, allowing an AI to learn to play the game autonomously. NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks to perform tasks, in this case, playing Flappy Bird.


*Clone the repository to your local machine:*
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm.git

*Navigate to the project directory:*
cd Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm

*Install the required Python modules using pip:*
pip install -r requirements.txt

*Install the NEAT Python module:*
pip install neat-python

*Install the Pygame module:*
pip install pygame

*To run the game with the NEAT algorithm:*
python Flappy-Bird-With-NEAT-Algorithm.py


*Configuration*
The feedforward.txt file contains the NEAT configuration parameters. You can adjust these parameters to change the behavior of the NEAT algorithm and experiment with different settings to improve the AI's performance.

*Acknowledgments*
This project is based on the implementation of Flappy Bird by sourabhv.
NEAT algorithm implementation is provided by NEAT-Python.
